# FEWD Denver 01 Class Repository

> Programming is not a zero-sum game. Teaching something to a fellow programmer doesn't take it away from you. I'm happy to share what I can, because I'm in it for the love of programming.

This is the class repo for the Denver inaugural FEWD course. Welcome Denver June  `16 FEWD students! =)

Herein you will find all the class notes, homework assignments, and administrivia that you need for the course.

This repo is managed by your instructor. 

Having said that, it generally follows the FEWD curriculum from General Assembly, with some modifications when considered important and relevant by your instructor.

## The basics/administrivia

### Your instructor: Alex Notov

* [Schedule office hours](https://calendly.com/zealoushacker/office-hours)

* [github](https://github.com/zealoushacker) | [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zealoushacker) | [twitter](https://twitter.com/zealoushacker)

* If you need to chat with the instructor privately, when we are not in class, please message me in the class [slack](https://ga-den-fwd.slack.com). Otherwise: 
    * Please use the [#general](https://ga-den-fwd.slack.com/messages/general/) chat room for any conversation that is related to the material, but isn’t a question. 
    * If you want to notify the instructor discuss assignments, please use the [#homework-and-projects](https://ga-den-fwd.slack.com/messages/homework-and-projects/) channel.
    * If you have questions, please use the [#questions](https://ga-den-fwd.slack.com/messages/questions/) channel. *The primary purpose of this channel is to give you a place to put questions that don’t require immediate answers during class, but need to be answered before the class is over.* Please feel free to interrupt the lesson with questions if you need an urgent explanation of something you had missed, or if you feel that there’s a general urgency to having the question answered.

### Other info

* The course notes shall be posted on or after the lesson day, and organized by week in folders with the format `Week_XX_TopicName`.

* Inside each folder, there may be an `Assignment` folder, containing the assignment for that day. Sometimes assignments will span the duration of more than one lesson day, or more than one week of lessons. Please be aware of this.

* Assignments are due the day before the next lesson day, or in the morning before 10am the day of the next lesson. If you have an assignment on a Monday, it’s due on Wednesday at 10am, at the latest. If the assignment is given on a Wednesday, it’s due next Monday.

### Course Schedule

This schedule is relatively “loose” and some material will be taught interchangeably or on different days, at the choice of the instructor. The schedule is only an outline of the general material covered during the course, and is here to provide basic guidance on what’s coming and what to expect.
